title: Evgeny Konoplev
position: Frontend Developer
annotation: I have more than 10 years of experience in web development, where my base languages were PHP and JS. Last 5 years I am working with Vue.js and Node.js. Two years ago I made my pet project with Flutter. Last year I started to learn TypeScript and React. In my current role as Senior fullstack web developer at medical company (one of leaders in laboratory services in Central Asia), I proved to be an enthusiastic, efficient and valuable team member. At my previous work I had a leadership role with 10 member's team. We practiced SCRUM, finished a big project and became a great friends.
