    - Github is just a base for tons of my pet projects.
    - While you read this I have already created new repo.
    - I'm very curious at any current physical, math or cultural researching, so I wish to find myself while helping to real scientists.
    - And I see my own purpose in developing some useful things which can help to make new discoveries (or just for fun).
Bottom: Right now I just want to have my personal page to share my CV and my ideas.
