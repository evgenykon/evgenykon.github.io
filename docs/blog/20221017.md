It's a very important theme for me. And very scary. Nuclear war.

I think about what can I do with all of that nightmare outside the window. And my option is to build a small project where I can say about my position. 

I think I have to collect some facts about world nuclear weapons, targets, politics that can destroy everything. And do something with that, for example - some ideas how to resist it, how to protect yourself, save human lives. 

How great it would be to unite against nuclear madness.
