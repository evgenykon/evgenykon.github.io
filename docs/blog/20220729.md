I groupped some old repos to single project [@webmusic](https://github.com/users/evgenykon/projects/7) and reanimated 
[SoundMixer](https://github.com/evgenykon/sound-mixer) repository. 

Want to realize web sound mixer with low latency while recording loops.

How? Don't know yet. But already make some UI.

WebAudio API is a point to my research.
