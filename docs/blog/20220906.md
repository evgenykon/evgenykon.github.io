This is a prediction of Khabib vs Conor famous fight in Oct 2018. And of course this fight is in past, and I know this is not fair. But good for test Neuron Network. The neuron activation parameters takes from my own opinion, but I want to believe that it is possible to find that values from some specific analyst researches. 

I have built the model based on [Synaptic](https://github.com/cazala/synaptic/wiki/Networks#neurons) library for JS. 

So. I am continue my researching of Machine Learning (and looking for good dataset). Want to prepare some valuable predictions to the next event (Chimaev - Diaz). I'm not sure but want to finish in time.

 Welcome to new repo in my Github (link in this page's header).
